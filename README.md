# node-bitlyapi

A NodeJS interface for the public Bitly API

For more information about the Bitly API: [dev.bitly.com](http://dev.bitly.com "Bitly API")

### Dependencies

node-bitlyapi requires the btoa, request and querystring node modules (installed via NPM)

### Installation

	npm install node-bitlyapi

### Version

The current published version of node-bitlyapi is 0.4.0. It is API complete, but missing some of the helper objects I intend to create.

## Usage

node-bitlyapi uses Bitly's OAuth implementation, so you'll need to register an OAuth application with them.
[Register a Bitly OAuth app](https://bitly.com/a/oauth_apps "Bitly OAuth Apps")

	var BitlyAPI = require("node-bitlyapi");
	var bitly = new BitlyAPI({
		client_id: "Something",
		client_secret: "Something"	
	});

You can then either authenticate using your username and password

	bitly.authenticate(username, password, function(err, access_token) {
		// Returns an error if there was one, or an access_token if there wasn't 
	});

or if you know your OAuth access_token, you can simply call:

	bitly.setAccessToken(access_token);

## The Bitly Object

Each of the public Bitly API endpoints are mapped and available with the following method signature

	bitly.[method name](parameters, callback(error, response){

	});

For Example:

	bitly.shorten({longUrl:"https://github.com/nkirby/node-bitlyapi"}, function(err, results) {
		// Do something with your new, shorter url...
	});

Where parameters is a key-value object {} according to Bitly's API documentation.

## Helpers

To make navigating the Bitly API a bit easier, a handful of small wrapper objects & methods have been provided to make your life a bit easier. 

### Shortening

Since the vast majority of Bitly's usage is through shortening, I've provided a simpler alternative to the standard Bitly.shorten mapping:

	bitly.shortenLink("https://github.com/nkirby/node-bitlyapi", function(err, results) {

	});

### Objects

The following objects are provided to wrap the API in a friendlier manner

#### BitlyUser
	
	bitly.user()
	bitly.user('login')
	bitly.user('login').getLinkHistory(null, function(err, results) {
		// Gets the public link history of "login"
	});

For more information about a BitlyUser - [Wiki](https://github.com/nkirby/node-bitlyapi/wiki/BitlyUser "BitlyUser")

#### BitlyLink

	bitly.link('http://bit.ly/1eOHYrA')
	bitly.link('http://bit.ly/1eOHYrA').getInfo(function(err, results) {

	});

#### BitlyBundle

Despite being Bitly's iOS developer, this project doesn't mean that

	a) I know anything more or less about iOS because of it.
	b) Or, inversely, that I know more or less about JavaScript, CoffeeScript or whatever else script is coming up next.
	c) That Bitly approves, condones, supports or even acknowledge this project.

Feel free to use this to make great NodeJS apps using Bitly's API. Your usage of their API is subject to their terms and conditions. Don't be a jackass, or a spammer...or a jackass spammer.
